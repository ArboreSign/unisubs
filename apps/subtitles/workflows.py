Subtitle Workflows
==================

Subtitle workflows control how subtitle sets get edited and published.  In
particular they control:

- Work Modes -- Tweak the subtitle editor behavior (for example review mode)
- Actions -- User actions that can be done to subtitle sets (Publish,
  Approve, Send back, etc).
- Permissions -- Who can edit subtitles, who can view private subtitles

.. autoclass:: Workflow
    :members: get_work_mode, get_actions, action_for_add_subtitles,
        get_editor_notes, extra_tabs, get_add_language_mode,
        user_can_edit_subtitles, user_can_view_private_subtitles
.. autofunction:: get_workflow(video)

Editor Notes
------------
.. autoclass:: EditorNotes

Work Modes
----------
.. autoclass:: WorkMode

Actions
-------

Actions are things things that users can do to a subtitle set other than
changing the actual subtitles.  They correspond to the buttons in the editor
at the bottom of the workflow session (publish, endorse, send back, etc).
Actions can occur alongside changes to the subtitle lines or independent of
them.
