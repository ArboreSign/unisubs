Comfortably get back into the rhythm again, <br>heart rate was peaking up at 170.
I'm gutted. <br>Absolutely gutted.
Got it back in my legs to get <br>to the top but, snow's in the way.
Just want to go and have a look. <br>Just round that corner and if there's tarmac...
This is nuts! Just that corner there, <br>I carry the bike through to there and I'm off.
What?<br>No, I need to get up round here. Anyone?
12 metres high mate, <br>we've gotta go back.
What the snow? <br>Yeah. We cant go on.
He's saying you could die mate, <br>we've gotta go.
Thank you.<br>Thank you.
Yesterday, after we got snowed out <br>of Madeleine, ah, I was absolutely gutted.
My legs would've got me up there, <br>but Madeleine said no.
I had a bit of a brief this morning, <br>as to what's to come...
So today we've got another legendary <br>Tour de France climb for you to take on,
the Col de la Croix de Fer <br>which is the "Call of the Iron Cross".
It was first used in the tour in 1947.
So they've been coming up <br>here for over 50 years.
The last 5 or 6k's from what I hear <br>is gonna smash my legs to pieces.
I'm gunning for this one. <br>I need this one in the bag.
[Music]
There you go buddy. <br>Thank you.
[Music plays again]
Just find a good rhythm.<br>Yeah.
Find a good rhythm, tap it out.<br>Feel the rhythm! Feel the rhythm!
[laughs]
Ahh, I've got no pacing left.
You can do it. <br>Dig, dig, dig, dig!
Oh (breathes heavily).
This is not your lungs, <br>it's your legs just exploding.
We're coming into cloud land now. <br>[Puffing] Oh! My ears popped. Jeez.
You get the impression <br>they do not want you at the top.
[radio static]<br>...you're about 100 metres away.
Oh, hands are like ice blocks! <br>Feet, can't even feel my toes. Oh.
Oh my legs! <br>Can't even hold a straight line.
It's such a long day out, <br>but, this, don't even know now,
how much further you've got to go <br>'cos you can't see in front of you.
[Applause and cheering]
We're getting there are we there? <br>Are we there?
[Car beeps horn]
Yes!
[Cheering continues]
Yeah! How's that!
Ollie! Ollie! Ollie!
