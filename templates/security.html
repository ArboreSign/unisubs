<h2>Security</h2>


    <h3>How to report an incident</h3>
    <p>We take security incidents very seriously. If you've found an exploit or any potential breach please let us know. Send an email to
        <a href="mailto:security@amara.org">security@amara.org</a> with as much information as possible.  </p>
    <p>All emails will be answered in up to 24 hours, even if the fix will take longer to be written and tested.</p>
    <p>We ask for reports not be disclosed until we've had a chance to secure it. As soon as we acknowledge the report, you'll have direct contact with our security team, where additional information can be exchanged.</p>
    <p>If you not only have found out an exploit, but already have a fix for it, we'd much appreciate if you don't submit a pull request directly in Github, where our source code is hosted. This would effectively disclose the issue and give us no time ahead of potential malicious attackers. Instead, we ask you to send the patch through the aforementioned email address above. </p>
    <p>Once the fix is released, we'll acknowlege it publicly and give credit to the original reporter.</p>

    <h3>Data and privacy</h3>
    <p>It's paramount to Amara that your data is safe. We have a distributed data storage platform will keep your data safe in the face of hardware failure and take daily data snapshots just in case.</p>
    <p>We rely industry standard practices and security conscious vendors to keep our system safe.</p>
    <p>We keep all base software up to date with the latest security patches, and all servers are monitored against intrusion.</p>
