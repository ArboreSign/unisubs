Syncing
===============

Integrations with external video hosts are done in the externalsites app.

Currently supported integration are with:
* youtube (team and individual)
* brightcove (team-only)
* kaltura (team-only)

Team integrations are configured by the team admin on the settings/integration
page.  

Youtube syncing
--------------

See the youtube syncing section.


Brightcove syncing
------------------

Brightcove integration requires the user to configure their Brightcove
Publisher ID and write token to sync subtitles.  

Users can optionally setups a feed to automatically import videos. 

Individual videos can also be added to the team.  Amara has support for the
brightcove player in the editor and embedder.

Kaltura syncing
---------------

Kalture syncing requires the user to configure their Kaltura
Partner ID and Secret code.

Amara currently does not have support for the Kaltura player in
the editor or the embedder, therefore users must create an rss feed
in Kaltura, and add the feed to their team on amara.
