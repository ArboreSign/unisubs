Kaltura syncing
===============

Kalture syncing requires the user to configure their Kaltura
Partner ID and Secret code.

Amara currently does not have support for the Kaltura player in
the editor or the embedder, therefore users must create an rss feed
in Kaltura, and add the feed to their team on amara.
